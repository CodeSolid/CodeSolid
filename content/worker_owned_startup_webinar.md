### Co-op Friday!
Hi, John Lockwood here.  This Friday, December 4th at 12:00 - 1:30 PM, I'll be attending the a Worker Cooperative Startup Roadmap Webinar -- for more details, see the [seminar description](http://bit.ly/1MNIgQy) and the [registration form](http://bit.ly/1MYdlyQ).  In order not to use my day job work computer for this, I'm planning to bring a laptop over to the Rancho Cordova [Panera Bread](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panera+Bread/@38.5828484,-121.2840407,17.25z/data=!4m7!1m4!3m3!1s0x809add4785713345:0x2efccac25f41a59a!2sZinfandel+Dr+%26+International+Dr+(NB)!3b1!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x1c3fbdb74508b9c9), so if you can join me "on-site", that's great.  Otherwise if you'd like to attend but can't make it over to Panera, you can also attend using the [registration form](http://bit.ly/1MYdlyQ).  

This is the first of many outside events I'll either be attending or hosting by way of organizing. Of course, I'll still be putting in the [hours](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeSolid/Goalboost/master/docs/hours.json) creating our first project, [Goalboost](http://goalboost.com).  But I'm also encouraged that now at least three people have mentioned to me that they have some sort of interest in CodeSolid / Goalboost.  I'm assuming that's because of the novelty of the employee owned source model rather than any technical merits -- which so far consist of about 125 hours of proof of concept and a big unwritten promisory note.

It will be exciting to build this out further.  I hope you can join me on Friday.
