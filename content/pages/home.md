We are actively seeking collaborators for Goalboost, because the goal is to collaborate and ship something, but we're also open to other project ideas.

## The Big Why

We're launching this thing while working a day job, and a day job is great and necessary, but you know you're getting pennies on the dollar compared to the guy at the top of the organization (yeah, usually it's a guy, that's another thing).  Or you can go home and work on some open source gizmo for "accolades and a sense of community" -- but then you won't even make the pennies.

We are building the alternative. We work hard together. We make descisions through a democratic process. We get all the accolades and the community from each other. And when the dollars roll in, we keep them.

And as for the pennies, maybe we'll spend those on marketing.

## A Vision for You

Our goal is to bring a small, tightly focused team of software professionals together to collaborate on building SaaS applications, in which we individually build equity through the number of hours dedicated to the project. We will further elaborate the details together, but the core idea is simple:  the more you work on a project, the more equity you build.  One hour equals one share, and the total shares equals the hours until project completion.  We currently have one project under development, but you can sponsor new ones if you wish.  See [How to Contribute](/contribute.html).

But what about capital?  Well, what about it?  You'll need a Github account and a set of development tools -- basically the same tools you would need to work for free on an open source project.  Sure, a venture capitalist would mean someone would pay us to start and buy the computer for you -- but once the value is built they'll give us pennies on the dollar for the privilege.
We prefer to bring our own shovels and seeds and water -- but then we get to eat the entire crop when it's harvest time.

Of course, this model means that none of us can do this as a day job, at least not at first.
