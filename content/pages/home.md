Welcome to CodeSolid.  We are a small team of SasS application developers organized as a Worker Owned Cooperative.

    Build equity hour by hour on an existing project or bring your own and convince your fellow owners to work on your dream.  We are not just employee owned, we're employee led.</p>

<h3>A Tech Coop, a Tech Startup, and Yet Different from Both</h3>

<p>CodeSolid is different from most tech coops in a two important ways. First, many tech coops are service businesses, focused on immediate profits through client projects.  As a product company, CodeSolid has a longer term focus and is thus ideal for developers with day jobs to pursue in their part time -- though in the long term we hope to establish it as a full time business.</p>

<p>Secondly, unlike most tech coops, we are not arguing that software should be free -- on the contrary, our focus is on creating software of sufficient value to generate substantial revenue, without the development of this software being underwritten by outside investors.</p>

<p>Unlike most tech startups, however, the only investors we care to pitch are each other -- our fellow developers and designers, the people who do real work.  We are employee owned capitalists.</p>

<!--
We're launching this thing while working a day job, and a day job is great and necessary, but you know you're getting pennies on the dollar compared to the guy at the top of the organization (yeah, usually it's a guy, that's another thing).  Or you can go home and work on some open source gizmo for "accolades and a sense of community" -- but then you won't even make the pennies.

We are building the alternative. We work hard together. We make descisions through a democratic process. We get all the accolades and the community from each other. And when the dollars roll in, we keep them.

And as for the pennies, maybe we'll spend those on marketing.
