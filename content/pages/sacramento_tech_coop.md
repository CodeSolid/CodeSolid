### Working for Yourself != Working Alone

Are you a software developer, designer, QA, or the like who's looking to learn more about what employee owned businesses are all about?   Are you looking to start or join a tech coop?  The Sacramento Tech Coop Meetup is a monthly meeting for everyone interested in forming a new coop or joining an existing tech coop in the Sacramento area.  

We are primarily interested in commercial coops, that is to say, coops which are organized at least in part with a view to short term or long term profitability for the members participating.  That said, we also welcome folks who are new to the software field or exploring options for learning it.

The meetup is being sponsored by CodeSolid, which as far as we know is the only tech coop in the Sacramento area -- and yes, we are looking for new members.  That said, we know that our model is certainly not the only one for tech coops, nor even is it the most popular one, since "service company" coops seem to outnumber "product company" coops on a national basis (at least in our experience).  So we're very interested in exploring alternative ideas at the same time as we want to promote our own.
