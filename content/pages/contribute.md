Here's how you can be a part of the CodeSolid Employee Owned Cooperative.

* Start working on one of our [existing projects](/category/projects.html).  Take a look at the open issues for the project, or contact one of the committers on the project, to see what pull requests we're looking for.  One hour of productive work equals one share of ownership -- dividends when we turn a profit will be distributed accordingly.  However, we're 100% employee owned, so we subscribe to the principle of one person, one vote.  

* Subscribe to our mailing list to hear about company announcements and organizational meetings.  Send an email to <mailto:codesolid-subscribe@yahoogroups.com>.  Our mailing list is our official vehicle for company communication (which currently is very sparse, by the way).  All meetings are optional, but all voting on important issues takes place through the mailing list, so you must subscribe to vote.

* Suggest a new project.  We'd love to hear from you on the mailing list.
