There are many ways you can contribute to the CodeSolid Employee Owned Software Cooperative.  Here are some ideas:

* Start working on one of our [existing projects](/category/projects.html).  Take a look at the open issues for the project, or contact one of the committers on the project, to see what pull requests we're looking for.

* Subscribe to our mailing list to hear about company announcements and organizational meetings.  Send an email to <mailto:codesolid-subscribe@yahoogroups.com>.

* Suggest a new project, perhaps by sending an email to the mailing list, or by forking the [CodeSolid Web Site Source](https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid) and creating a project page based on our [Project Page Template](https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid/blob/master/content/project_template.md)

* Say hello on Twitter - [@CodeSolid](https://twitter.com/CodeSolid).  

* Call John Lockwood at (916) 359-9218 and let's talk about what we want to organize and work on together.
