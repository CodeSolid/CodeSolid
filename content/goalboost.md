Excerpt: Our first collective project, Goalboost, is a time and billing application that we will be offering as a SasS application.  It will also feature an API through which mobile devices can be written to extend its value.
Category: Projects

Goalboost is a time and billing application, which is a natural first project for two reasons.  First, time and billing is the sort of application that stands a decent chance of being commercially successful, inasmuch as it meets a real business need.  Secondly, in our own work we wish to track hours per project as part of our equity sharing system, so writing a time and billing app that we delight in using is a way of eating our own dogfood.

Goalboost is being developed written using Python 3, Flask, and MongoDB, and AngularJS.
