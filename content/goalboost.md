We currently have a single active project, Goalboost.  Goalboost is a time and billing application, which is a natural first project for two reasons.  First, time and billing is the sort of application that stands a decent chance of being commercially successful, inasmuch as it meets a real business need.  Secondly, in our own work we wish to track hours per project as part of our equity sharing system, so writing a time and billing app that we delight in using is a way of eating our own dogfood.

We currently have Goalboost hosted privately, but we'll be putting it up on Github soon so you can kick the tires -- trying out our new [employee owned source license](/license).
