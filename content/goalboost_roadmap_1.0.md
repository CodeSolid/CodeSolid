This is a draft roadmap for the [Goalboost](/goalboost.html) project.  I'll be adding to this as we go.
Change history is in git -- see the [Github repository](https://github.com/CodeSolid/CodeSolid).

## Project resources

We currently have 1 part time resource, working about 10 hours per week.  This means I can do about one 125-hour Sprint per quarter.  On that basis we estimate completion in about four years (i.e., about one mythical man year).  

In an effort to improve on that timeline and go full time on this more quickly, we are actively seeking contributors who wish to contribute under the [Employee Owned Source Code](http://localhost:8000/employee_owned_source_code.html) [license](https://github.com/CodeSolid/Goalboost/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

## Sprint 1 - *It's About Time*

Sprint one is almost over?  Wow, time flies when you're tracking it using a combination of Python, MongoDB, and AngularJS!  
Here's what we worked on in [Sprint 1](/goalboost_sprint_1.html).

## Sprint 2 - *We Love Users - Customers Who Can't Pay Yet*

Sprint 2 is in progress.  Here are some [working notes on Sprint 2](/goalboost_sprint_2.html)

## Sprint 3 - *Timers Need a Home -- Invoices and Projects*
* Models and testing for invoices and projects.
* UI to create invoices.
## Sprint 4 - *If you can bill them, I can bill you*
Here we'll focus on ways to send invoices.  

- We'll be able to email an invoice by the end of this sprint.
- That sounds unambitious, but it involves either a new security model for the invoice link or a basic PDF invoice "report".
## Sprint 5 - *No seriously, you'll want to be billing people*

- Begin work on [paypal invoice integration](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/invoicing/IntroInvoiceAPI/).  Do proof of concept.
## Sprint 6
- Finish Paypal proof of concept.
## Sprint 7 *It's all right here in my report*
- Reports and queries.

## Sprint 8
- Basically it all trails off from here.  We need more detail front loaded, and more detail here.
