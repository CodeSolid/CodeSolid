Excerpt: Why are there not more employee owned software companies?
Status: draft

For some time now the idea of starting an employee owned software company has periodically stopped by to mock me for not having somehow magically accomplished it without much effort.  That's not a very companionable thing for an idea to do, so in this post I take the idea out for a bit of a ride in the morning air to see if it can be rendered less cantankerous.
